Database performance can be improved beyond connection pooling. Replication, load balancing, and in-memory caching can contribute to efficient database performance.

If a web service is designed to make a lot of read and write queries to a database, then you have multiple instances of a Postgres database in place to take care of write queries from clients through a load balancer such as pgpool-II while in-memory caching can be used to optimize read queries.

Despite the pgpool-II ability to function as a loader balancer and connection pooler, pgbouncer is the preferred middleware solution for connection pooling because it is easy to set up, not too difficult to manage, and primarily serves as a connection pooler without any other functions.Â
